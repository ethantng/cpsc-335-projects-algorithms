Overview:
The program is a burning trees simulation done on a 2d grid that represents a forest. Each cell within the grid can have 3 different states which include 0 being empty, 1 being a healthy tree, and 2 being a burning tree. The goal of this program is to output the minimum number of days that is required to burn down all of the healthy trees in the forest.
